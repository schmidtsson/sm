<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>What else. He was one of a group of scientists who
went into Hiroshima after the war to report on the damage. I think he was
sobered by what he saw. I cant really speak for him. Whoever made the bomb was
going to blow something up with it and I’m sure he&nbsp;thought better us than
them. Whoever them might turn out to be. The arguments about Truman’s decision
generally center around the loss of life in a land invasion. My father had
another take on it. He thought that if Japan had been defeated in a land
invasion there would have been no miracle of reconstruction after the war. That
Japan would have been humiliated as a nation and would have entered into a long
decline. But as it was, they were not defeated in battle. They were defeated by
witchcraft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>I dont know. It’s a theory. Invented and patented by
my father. I dont have any politics. And I’m pacifist to the bone. Only a
nation can make war—in the modern sense—and I dont like nations. I believe in
running away. Much as you’d step out of the path of an oncoming bus. If we’d
had a child I would take it to where war seemed least probable. Although it’s
hard to outguess history. But you can try. No I dont, to answer your next question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>You dont think that your father lost any sleep over
the bomb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>My father didnt sleep before the bomb and he didnt
sleep after. I think most of the scientists didnt give that much thought to
what was going to happen. They were just having a good time. They all said the
same thing about the Manhattan Project. That they’d never had so much fun in
their lives. But anyone who doesnt understand that the Manhattan Project is one
of the most significant events in human history hasnt been paying attention.
It’s up there with fire and language. It’s at least number three and it may be
number one. We just dont know yet. But we will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>You think that your father didnt really dwell on the
outcome of the project.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>I think that he did dwell. And that he was unusual in
that. He didnt have a lot of sympathy with all the handwringing that went on
after Hiroshima. He was older than most of the scientists. I think the average
age was around twenty-six or twenty-seven. I think a few were even in their
teens. When they suddenly became peacemongers he just thought they were a bunch
of hypocrites. After the war he worked with Teller. They detonated bombs
capable of reducing fairly large parcels of the known world to uninhabitable
rubble. Everybody hated Teller and they hated my father. Too bad. I dont know
what to tell you about his sleep. I never slept either. And I didnt bomb
anybody.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>It’s called Boxing Day because that’s the day you box
up all the crap you got that you dont want and take it back to the store.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>That’s not true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>You’d have to define estranged. I dont think
entirely. But then I wasnt there. Anyway, I dont fault him for going to hear
Gödel. I would have. Even though Gödel just read the paper in a monotone. The
paper was on the foundations of mathematics. Mostly it was a defense of
platonism. I dont know that my father was all that interested in the subject
but he was interested in Gödel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Have you read the paper?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Yes. Of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Of course?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>I’ve read practically all of Gödel’s papers. Most of
the notes. Including those written in Gabelsberger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>What is that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>It’s the shorthand that Gödel used. In keeping with
his other idiosyncrasies. It’s nineteenth century German. Maybe eighteenth, I
dont know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>How long did it take you to learn it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Longer than I would have thought. Gödel was smart,
but among other things he was a mathematical platonist and I wanted to know
why. To me the idea was simply incoherent. But then I didnt really know how
smart Gödel was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Now I’m not even sure I know what that means.
Mathematical platonist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>What it sounds like? It’s usually called realism
nowadays. It supposedly expresses a belief in the existence of mathematical
entities independent of the human mind. It’s a belief common to older
mathematicians and to me it just seemed full of holes. If mathematical objects
exist independently of human thought what else are they independent of? The
universe, I suppose. When you solve a problem there is always the compelling
sense that the solution was there and that you have discovered it. Besides
which it has a certain empirical weight to it in that other mathematicians will
agree with you that the answer is correct. If it is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>And I suppose this has at least something to do with
your understanding of reality in general.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Well. You can spend a lot of time categorizing realities.
Their correspondences. We probably dont want to start down that road.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>All right. I dont know that much about Gödel. I know
that he had a famous theory that mathematics couldnt solve all the questions it
posed. Or something like that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Something like that, yes. Two theorems. In 1931.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Is that a theory you agree with?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Of course. The paper explaining them is brilliant.
It’s beyond argument. In his later years Gödel drifted away from mathematics
into philosophy. Then he went crazy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>How crazy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Pretty bad. He wouldnt eat. Thought the food was
poisoned. When he died he weighed about seventy pounds. Oppenheimer was head of
IAS at the time and he would go over to see him in the hospital. One day the
doctor came in. He didnt know who Gödel was—just some nutty professor from the
university—and Oppenheimer told him to take good care of Gödel because he was
the greatest logician since Aristotle. And the doctor nodded and began to edge
toward the door and Oppenheimer realized that he was thinking: Good God, now
there’s two of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>His theory. Is it true that it cast doubt over the
legitimacy of mathematics? Is that why it’s famous?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>No. That’s all nonsense. It may have started with von
Neumann. He was present at Gödel’s presentation to the Vienna Circle and when
Gödel finished reading the papers von Neumann said: It’s all over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

I’ve thought for a long time that the basic truths of mathematics must
transcend number. It is after all a rather ramshackle affair. For all its
considerable beauty. The laws of mathematics supposedly derive from the rules
of logic. But there is no argument for the rules of logic that does not
presuppose them. I suppose one thing that might evoke the analogy with the
spiritual is the understanding that the greatest spiritual insights seem to
derive from the testimonies of those who stand teetering in the dark.</span></p>

23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>It’s a requirement for not waking up tomorrow morning
and saying something extraordinarily stupid. You asked why Grothendieck left
mathematics. The notion that this implies lunacy, appealing as that may be, is
probably not altogether correct. It would certainly appear to be the case that
rewriting most of the mathematics of the past half century has done little to
allay his skepticism. Wittgenstein was fond of saying that nothing can be its
own explanation. I’m not sure how far that is from saying that things
ultimately contain no information concerning themselves. But it may be true
that you have to be on the outside looking in. You can ask what is even meant
by a description. Is there a better description of a cube than that of its
construction? I dont know. What can you say of any attribute other than that it
resembles some things and not others? Color. Form. Weight. When you’re faced with
a class of one you see the problem. It doesnt have to be something grand like
time or space. It can be something pretty everyday. The component parts of
music. Are there musical objects? Music is composed of notes? Is that right?
The complexity of mathematics has shifted it from a description of things and
events to the power of abstract operators. At what point are the origins of
systems no longer relevant to their description, their operation? No one,
however inclined to platonism, actually believes that numbers are requisite to
the operation of the universe. They’re only good to talk about it. Is that
right?</span></p>

understand numbers you wont even see the wall. People from the other side will
seem odd to you. And you will never understand the latitude which they extend
to you. They will be cordial—or not—depending on their nature. Of course one
might also add that intelligence is a basic component of evil. The more stupid
you are the less capable you are of doing harm. Except perhaps in a clumsy and
inadvertent manner. The word cretin comes from the French chrétien. Supposedly
if you could think of nothing good to say about a dullard you would say that he

separate the U-238 found in nature from U-235. In a thousand pounds of natural
uranium there’s only about seven pounds of U-235, so that’s a lot of shoveling
just to get started. There are several ways of separating it—enriching it, they
like to say—and the electromagnetic system isnt the best, it was just the
first. The calutron was invented by E O Lawrence and it was basically a mass
spectrometer and acted as the collection device for the enriched uranium. Cal
was short for California. Tron is just from the Greek. A measuring scale, or
maybe an instrument. The uranium was first combined with chlorine and the
resulting uranium tetrachloride was then ionized and driven by a series of
electromagnets around what they called the racetrack. The racetrack was over a

borrowed fourteen thousand tons of silver and trucked that in and used&nbsp;it.</span></p>

tracks they designed, the Alpha tracks, werent all that efficient so they took
the material it produced and ran it again through a new design called the Beta

different. It was even smaller—about half the size of the Alpha, with ten foot
magnets. The calutrons themselves were inserted into the racetracks sideways
and the collectors were removed periodically and emptied. Of course what made
the whole system workable was that U-238 is three neutrons heavier than U-235
so that it follows a greater arc in a magnetic field.</span></p>

Autism occurs in males more than it does in females. So does higher order
mathematical intuition. We think: What is this about? Dont know. What is at the
heart of it? Dont know. All I can tell you is that I like numbers. I like their
shapes and their colors and their smells and the way they taste. And I dont
like to take people’s word for things. My father finally did stay with us
during the last months of my mother’s illness. He had a study in the smokehouse
out back. He’d cut a big square hole in the wall and put in a window so he
could look out at the fields and the creek beyond. His desk was a wooden door
set up on sawhorses and there was an old leather sofa there that was stuffed
with horsehair. It was all dried and cracked and the horsehair was leaking out
but he put a blanket over it. I went in one day and sat at his desk and looked
at the problem he was working on. I already knew some math. Quite a bit,
actually. I tried to puzzle out the paper but it was hard. I loved the
equations. I loved the big sigma signs with the codes for the summations. I
loved the narrative that was unfolding. My father came in and found me there
and I thought I was in trouble and I jumped up but he took me by the hand and
led me back to the chair and sat me down and went over the paper with me. His
explanations were clear. Simple. But it was more than that. They were filled
with metaphor. He drew a couple of Feynman diagrams and I thought they were
pretty cool. They mapped the world of the subatomic particles he was attempting
to explain. The collisions. The weighted routes. I understood—really
understood—that the equations were not a supposition of the form whose life was
confined to the symbols on the page which described them but that they were
there before my eyes. In actuality. They were in the paper, the ink, in me. The
universe. Their invisibility could never speak against them or their being.
Their age. Which was the age of reality itself. Which was itself invisible and
always had been. He never let go of my hand.</span></p>

through our dark glasses as it came red and dripping up out of the sea. We’d
walked on the beach the night before and there was a moon and a mock moon that
rode in the rings and we talked about the paraselene and I said something to
the effect that to speak of such things which are composed solely of light as
problematic or perhaps as wrongly seen or even wrongly known or of questionable

said betrayal? And I said yes. Things composed of light. In need of our

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>What was startling was the anguish in those cries. I
began paying attention. There were always babies at the bus station and they
were always crying. And these were not mild complaints. I couldnt understand
how the least discomfort could take the form of agony. No other creature was so
sensitive. The more I thought about it the clearer it became to me that what I
was hearing was rage. And the most extraordinary thing was that no one seemed
to find this extraordinary. Except for Miss Vivian. Of course you could point
out that however gracious or kind or concerned she might be she was still an
old looney. Of problematic reality. So I took that home with me. I dont think
we ever really discussed it. She would just start weeping and shaking her head.
I thought if she had brought me all this baggage she must be expecting me to do
something about it but it began to get more complicated. I thought about it.
The rage of children seemed inexplicable other than as a breach of some deep
and innate covenant having to do with how the world should be and wasnt. I
understood that their raw exposure to the world was the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>The rules of music that guide a composer like
Bach…All right. There are not any composers like Bach. There’s just Bach. But
ignoring that for the moment, these rules can be learned by laymen. They are
there to be learned. Or not. They are there whether the first note of music was
ever written or not. Is that true?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Yes. It’s at least that bad. Schopenhauer thought
that if the universe vanished music alone would remain. The rules are the
music. Without the rules you have nothing but noise. When we hear a wrong note
we wince. We smile or weep or march to war. Can you explain any of that? How do
you know when someone is dancing? What if they are dancing out of time with the
music?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>No. But this set of rules—I think I’d call them laws,
laws of music—is selfcontained and complete. They are known and there will
never be any more of them. Is that true of mathematics? Is there such a thing
as a grand unifying theory of mathematics? Hilbert’s second thesis? Cantor’s
dream? It seems more than unlikely. Langlands or no. And yet must there not be
at least a description of mathematics? Both as it is and as it is to become? I
wanted to do mathematics. But I wanted to understand it as well. And I never
would. I couldnt even frame the question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>I’m surprised to hear you say that understanding
mathematics was beyond you. Is this something that concerns most
mathematicians? Or do they just go about the business of computation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>I think for most it’s a passing concern. At best.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>How do you know you shouldnt? The core question is
not how you do math but how does the unconscious do it. How is it that it’s
demonstrably better at it than you are? You work on a problem and then you put
it away for a while. But it doesnt go away. It reappears at lunch. Or while
you’re taking a shower. It says: Take a look at this. What do you think? Then
you wonder why the shower is cold. Or the soup. Is this doing math? I’m afraid
it is. How is it doing it? We dont know. I’ve posed the question to some pretty
good mathematicians. How does the unconscious do math? Some who’d thought about
it and some who hadnt. For the most part they seemed to think it unlikely that
the unconscious went about it the same way we did. What was surprising to me
was the insouciance with which they greeted this news. As if the very nature of
mathematics had not just been hauled into the dock. A few thought that if it
had a better way of doing mathematics it ought to tell us about it. Well,
maybe. Or maybe it thinks we’re not smart enough to understand it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Neither does anybody else. Sometimes you get a clear
sense that doing math is largely just feeding data into the substation and
waiting to see what comes out. I’m not even sure that it’s all that wise to
commit things to memory. What you log in becomes fixed. In a way that the
machinations of the unconscious would appear not to. I dont really like to
write things down. Is that good? I dont know. Grothendieck writes everything
down. Witten nothing. But I think for most people to leave things unrecorded is
to leave them free to look around for fresh analogies. They go about their
business and come back from time to time and report to you. A written
statement—or an equation—is a sort of signpost. A waystation. It tells you
where you are and gives you a new place to start from. Dirac draws pictures. I
dont think he believes there exist graphic representations of entities too
small to subtend a particle of light, but he has an engineering background and
it’s stuck with him. Odd things come in handy. People who are good with an
abacus can calculate pretty well with an imaginary one.</span></p>

conversation, I suppose—I have to make a series of concessions not just to your
point of view but to the actual form of the world seen from your place in it. I
can do that. But the problem is that for you it is never a question of point of
view. You’re never troubled to find yourself discussing quite peculiar things
in a fairly normal way. Maybe it’s just the naivete that you bring to the
table. You might say: Well, how else would you discuss them? But when the
subject is chimeras arent you already on somewhat shaky ground? I’ve thought
from early on that the Kid was there not to supply something but to keep
something at bay. And in the meantime the whole business is subsumed under the
rubric of a single reality which itself remains unaddressable. I wake in the
night in my room and lie there listening to the quiet. You ask where they are.
I dont know where they are. But they are not nowhere. Nowhere like nothing
requires for its affirmation a witness which it cannot supply by its own
definition. You’d be loath to grant these beings a will of their own, but if
they were not possessed of something like autonomy in what sense could they
then be said to exist? I’ve no power either to conjure them forth or send them
packing. I dont speak for them or see to their hygiene or their wardrobe. I
said that they were indistinguishable from living beings, but the truth is that
their reality is if anything more striking. Not just the Kid but all of them.
Their movements, their speech, the color and the fold of their clothes. There’s
nothing dreamlike about them. None of this is much help, is it? Well, people
dont listen to loonies. Until they say something funny.</span></p>

my memory of events largely because of the evidence I have for my ability at
memorization. Are they the same? The lines of a poem have no substance other,
but the events of history—including your personal history—have no substance at
all. Their materiality has vanished without a trace. My experience has been
that people with poor memories are just as ready to be right as anyone else.</span></p>

careful what you let in. But I wouldnt change it. I’ll never escape Plato. Or
Kant. Wittgenstein I regard as something of a contemporary. A fellow student.
Husserl I fell in love with. He was a mathematician, so I trusted him. He was
professor at Freiburg and he took in a young student named Martin Heidegger and
was his teacher and his mentor and then the Nazis came and they said that
Husserl would have to be dismissed because he was a Jew and Heidegger said why
yes, that was only right. And so Husserl cleared out his desk and went home and
sat and wept and then he died and Heidegger took over his chair. So the
question that we’re left with I suppose is that if human decency does not
represent something like the foundation of philosophical inquiry then what is
its purpose? Wittgenstein agonized his whole life over the state of his soul.
The question never seems to have occurred to Heidegger. How did I get to be the
counselor?</span></p>

watching and I turned around and he put the paper on my back and wrote on it. I

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Not much. I’ve read the standard accounts. My
father’s group was about six miles from ground zero. They’d been given glasses
that were very dark. I think something like welding goggles. But my father had
brought his own because he didnt think you’d be able to see much with the
government issue glasses. I guess you can read that as a metaphor. But all the
glasses had to do was block the ultraviolet light. They listened to the
countdown over a loudspeaker. They were a pretty nervous lot. Some that it
would go off and some that it wouldnt. The thing I remember my father saying
was that he put his hands over his goggles against the initial flare of light
and that when it came he could see the bones in his fingers with his eyes
closed. There was no sound. Just this searing white light. And then the reddish
purple cloud rising in billows and flowering into the iconic white mushroom.
Symbol of the age. The whole thing standing slowly to ten thousand feet. The
wind from the shockwave was supersonic and it hurt your ears for just a moment.
And lastly of course the sound of it. The ungodly detonation followed by the
slow rumble, the afterclap that rolled away over the burning countryside into a
world that had never existed before this side of the sun. The desert creatures
evaporating without a cry and the scientists watching with this thing standing
twinned in the black lenses of their goggles. And my father watching it through
his fingers like See-No-Evil. But if they knew nothing else they all knew it was
too late for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

stunned. A friend of my father’s, a physicist named Bainbridge who was head of
the program, said we’re all sons of bitches now. And supposedly Oppenheimer
quoted from the Bhagavad Gita but I think the Sanskrit word for Time came out
Death or maybe the other way around. Or maybe they’re the same.</span></p>

To be honest. At one point I was interested in the mathematics of the violin. I
corresponded with a woman in New Jersey named Carleen Hutchins who was trying
to map the harmonics of the instrument. She’d taken any number of rare Cremonas
apart with a soldering iron. She worked with some physicists setting up some
rather elaborate equipment to establish the Chladni patterns of the plates. But
the vibrations and frequencies were so complex that they resisted any complete
analysis. I thought that I could do mathematical models of these frequency
patterns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Carleen kept good records. The oldest known violin is
an Amati believed to be from 1564 that’s in the Ashmolean at Oxford. The oldest
instrument we studied was from 1580 and the latest was probably a German violin
from the 1960s. Aside from the angle of the neck they were the same. Nothing

Leonardo cant be explained. Or Newton, or Shakespeare. Or endless others. Well.
Probably not endless. But at least we know their names. But unless you’re
willing to concede that God invented the violin there is a figure who will
never be known. A small man who went with his son into the stunted forests of
the little iceage of fifteenth century Italy and sawed and split the maple
trees and put the flitches to dry for seven years and then stood in the slant
light of his shop one morning and said a brief prayer of thanks to his creator

wretched beyond telling. Most of the time I’d just curl up in bed and work on
math problems. Sometimes I’d look up and everybody would be gone except him.
Still pacing. He’d go over the books on my shelf and suggest further reading.
All of it nonsense of course. Some of it funny. Probably not to him. I
certainly never saw him laugh. Just this bogus yukking he would do. I told him
once that he was wasting his time. That I wanted to be a warrior. Not a being
of the spirit but of the flesh. I was a born classicist and my heroes were
never saints but killers. He would look quite serious and then hold forth with

23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>The dream wakes us to tell us to remember. Maybe
there’s nothing to be done. Maybe the question is whether the terror is a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>I dont think so. Psychiatrists have trouble dealing
with the unconscious in a straightforward way. But the unconscious is a purely
biological system, not a magical one. It’s a biological system because that’s
all there is for it to be. People arent happy talking about the unconscious
unless there’s a certain amount of hokum involved. But there isnt. The
unconscious is simply a machine for operating an animal. What else could it be?
Most of what we do is unconscious. Turning chores over to the conscious mind is
a risky business. Whales and dolphins have to time their breathing to their
surfacing. So of course when they were first anesthetized for surgery they simply
died. Which should have been predictable. The unconscious evolves along with
the species to meet its needs and if there’s anything spooky about it it’s that
it sometimes seems to anticipate those needs. It cant afford surprises. It’s
one of the things that troubled Darwin. But the souldoctors dont get any of
this. They’re Cartesian to the bone.</span></p>

viewing things. If we were constructed with a continual awareness of how we

23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>He showed up after a while. My little dybbuk and his
friends. My brother had given me a car and I used to drive up into the
mountains and sit with my feet in the creek and work problems in algebraic
topology. I’d read Noether’s papers and they were pretty straightforward.
Poincaré of course. What the Betti groups actually meant. The homology groups.
But it was how she got there. Aside from the fact that she knew more abstract
algebra than anybody else. I knew that in order to do what she’d done you would
first have to believe it. But this seemed different. Intuition is a tough nut
to crack. The cool thing about topology is that the problems you are working on
are not about something else. Your hope is that in solving them they will
explain to you why you were asking them. You’re tracking down the affine. Can
you really stretch a surface any way you like? What if you stretched it to
infinity? The width would narrow infinitely. Can the limits of the
infinitesimal be approached forever? The mathematics may say yes but you dont
believe it. Infinite extension is just more of the same but infinite
contraction seems to present a different set of problems. In the classical
understanding. You’re in Zeno land. Begin again and concentrate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>It’s all right. Add to your troubles the idea that
topology has questionable mathematical foundations—or none at all, as some of
its founders believed—and then what? You can say that it contains its own
logic, but isnt that the problem? If you claim that mathematics is not a
science then you can claim that it need have no referent save itself. When
Wittgenstein convinced Russell that all of mathematics was a tautology Russell
gave up mathematics.</span></p>

And the deeper question, which we touched on, is that if mathematical work is
performed mostly in the unconscious we still have no notion as to how it goes
about it. You can try and picture the inner mind adding and subtracting and
muttering and erasing and beginning again but you wont get very far. And why is
it so often right? Who does it check its work with? I’ve had solutions to
problems simply handed to me. Out of the blue. The locus ceruleus perhaps. And
it has to remember everything. No notes. It’s hard to escape the unsettling
conclusion that it’s not using numbers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>That might not be true. That it is that often right.
What’s probably true is that only the right answers get reported. At a
conference a while back I ran into the historian of the Manhattan Project. A
man named David Hawkins. We got to talking about math and he told me that what
first got him interested in the subject was the second chapter of Spengler’s <i>Decline
of the West.</i> Which is entitled “The Meaning of Numbers.” I asked him what
Spengler’s view was and he said that he wasnt sure. That Spengler seemed eager
to make a distinction between mathematics as numeracy and mathematics as
chronology. Which I thought was already pretty well established in the cardinal
and the ordinal but I assumed that Spengler was after something else. But I got
the book and read the opening chapter and a bit more here and there. As with
the general run of philosophers—if he is one—the most interesting thing was not
his ideas but just the way his mind worked. I read a bit more before I gave it
up but I thought it one of the more interesting pieces of nonsense I’d come
across. I dont think you can call him a crank. He knows too much. And it really
is well written. I think I would put him with Schopenhauer as an exemplar of
German prose. He makes some odd statements. The mathematics of night? I suppose
Grothendieck is capable of saying something like that. But Grothendieck is a
great mathematician. You have to take him seriously. Beginning this lengthy
study of what he takes to be the meaning of history with an inquiry into the meaning
of mathematics is a strategy that modern philosophers might well take into
consideration. An enormous amount of Wittgenstein’s work is in mathematics.
Very little of it published.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

notional. I dont know how you can write about the meaning of numbers with no
mention of Frege. Even in 1917 or ’19. But even Frege doesnt get completely
down to nuts and bolts. Adding and subtracting are not really mathematics. A
sack of pebbles will do. But multiplication and division are a different
matter. If you were to multiply two tomatoes by two tomatoes you wouldnt get
four tomatoes. You would get four tomatoes squared. So what is the two? Well.
It’s an independent abstract mathematical operator. Oh? And what is that? We
dont know. We made it up. Do you remember any of this from Math 101?</span></p>

Doing math is a bit like selling door to door. You have to learn to handle
rejection. I went through Hilbert’s problems. Not to solve them but to try to
find out what if anything they had in common. Mathematics was spreading out and
as it was spreading out it was thinning out. Sometime in the early twentieth
century it finally became impossible for anyone to understand all of it. Cantor
supposedly was the last universal mathematician. Then Poincaré. Then no one.
Anyway, there were times when I considered that my career might be over. And at
the same time I never questioned my ability. I was the best mathematician I
knew.</span></p>

D Lee was working on non-Abelian gauge theory he came across a mathematics

his mathematics friends and asked them to explain this but they didnt see what
needed explaining. But Lee said that while the gauge theory was a physical
theory and therefore real the fiber-bundle theory was not a physical theory and
therefore&nbsp;not real. And they got upset and they said no no no it is real.
Topology is able to describe with some precision forms that belie physical
exemplification. Yet they cant be ideations because then you have to ask
ideations of what? Anyway, by the end of the summer I had more or less dug

Bobby researched it. The woman who landed at Ellis Island in 1848 was fifteen.
She’d left Europe with her mother but her mother never arrived. She wasnt on
the debarkation list. There was no explanation on the manifest but she had to
have died at sea. Did this girl have anyone to meet her? I dont know.</span></p>

married by the time she was sixteen. Bobby tried to find out about her family
in Europe. Our family. There wasnt much. The Europe she fled was pledged to
endless war. There were Jewish families that walked across Asia to ports on the
Russian coast. Carrying their suitcases. When Bobby told Uncle Royal that we
were Jews Uncle Royal ordered him out of the house.</span></p>

the panic attendant to suffocation is atavistic. It’s as old as the brain and
there’s nothing you can do about it. You might think that you can screw your

we share with rats. You could say that fear of falling is also primitive, but
climbers who have fallen to what they believed to be their deaths universally
report calm and acceptance. Why is that?</span></p>

going to have to make the decision to breathe in the water and die. You may
think that the decision will be made for you, but even if you cant hold your
breath for another second you can hold it another millisecond. And of course
it’s not a choice but a decision. You have to make the decision to kill
yourself. There’s nothing like that in falling to your death. The movies dont
get that right either. There’s no kicking and screaming. You’re absolved of all

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Okay. My thought was to rent a boat. I was sitting in
the pine woods above the lake and I thought about the incredible clarity of the
water and I could see that was a plus. You really dont want to drown yourself
in muddy water. It’s something people ought to think about. I saw myself
sitting in the boat with the oars shipped. At some point I would take a last
look around. I would have a heavy leather belt and a goodsized padlock from the
hardware store and I would have fastened myself to the chain of the anchor
through the belt where it doubles after passing through the buckle. Click the
padlock shut and drop the key over the side. Maybe row off a few strokes. You
dont want to be down there on the bottom scrambling around looking for a key.
You take one last look and lift the anchor into your lap and swing your feet
over the side and push off into eternity. The work of an instant. The work of a
lifetime.</span></p>

23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>I didnt. First of all the water off the east shore is
about sixteen hundred feet deep and agonizingly cold. A number of things are
going to happen that you hadnt taken into consideration. Of course if you had
you wouldnt be there in the first place. Or the last. As you descend, your
lungs will start to shrivel. At a thousand feet they’ll be about the size of
tennisballs. You try to clear your ears and that hurts. Your eardrums in all
likelihood are going to burst and that is really going to hurt. There is a
technique for bringing up air and forcing it through the eustachian tubes into
your ears but you arent going to have the air to do it with. So you drift down
in your thin chain of bubbles. The mountains draw away. The receding sun and
the painted bottom of the boat. The world. Your heart slows to a tick. Dive
deep enough and it will stop altogether. The blood is leaving your extremities
to pool in your lungs. But the biggest problem is just coming. You’re going to
run out of air before you reach the bottom of the lake. Even with a sixty pound
anchor—about all I could manage—you’re not going to make very good time. At
twelve miles an hour—which is pretty fast—you’re doing a thousand feet a
minute. Under the circumstances that you’ve chosen for yourself a breath may
not last a minute. Even if you’ve done the fast respirations before you
committed. The shock and the stress and the cold and the diminishing air supply
are going to take their toll. Anyway, it’s going to be a good two minute trip
to the bottom and probably more like four or five. Not sitting comfortably on
the bottom of the lake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>I know. Anyway, at this juncture you’ll have dropped
the anchor and it is going to be towing you by your belt down through water
that is freezing your brain. It’s unlikely you’ll be able to keep your wits
about you but it really doesnt matter. When you finally give up your rat’s
struggle and breath in the water—scaldingly cold—you are going to experience
pain beyond the merely agonizing. Maybe it will distract you from the mental
anguish at what you have done to yourself, I dont know. See if you can remember
the pain in your lungs from being out of breath from running on a cold winter
day. You’re breathing in quicker than your lungs can warm the air. It hurts.
Now multiply that by God knows what. The heat content of water as compared to
that of air. And it’s not going to go away. Because your lungs can never warm
the water they’ve inhaled. I think we’re talking about an agony that is simply
off the scale. No one’s ever said. And it’s forever. Your forever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

of the lake will be pretty much gravel so there wont be any billowing silt when
the anchor touches down. Total silence. No telling what’s down there. The
corpses of those who have gone before. A family you didnt know you had. It’s
deep enough that the light is pretty dim for all the clarity of the water. A
cold gray world. Not black yet. No life. The only color is the thin pink stain
trailing away in the water from the blood leaking out of your ears. We dont
know about the gag reflex but we’re fixing to find out.</span></p>

gagging? Dont know. No one’s ever said. The autonomous reflex will be to cough
out the water but you cant because it’s too heavy. And of course there’s
nothing to replace it with anyway except more water. In the meantime oxygen
deprivation and nitrogen narcosis have begun to compete for your sanity. You’re
sitting on the glacial floor of the lake with the weight of the water in your
lungs like a cannonball and the pain of the cold in your chest is probably
indistinguishable from fire and you are gagging in agony and even though your
mind is beginning to go you are yet caught in the iron grip of a terror utterly
atavistic and over which you have no control whatsoever and now out of nowhere
there’s a new thought. The extraordinary cold is probably capable of keeping
you alive for an unknown period of time. Hours perhaps, drowned or not. And you
may well assume that you will be unconscious but do you know that? What if
you’re not? As the reasons for not doing to yourself what you have just
irrevocably done accumulate in your head you will be left weeping and gibbering
and praying to be in hell. Anyway, sitting there among the trees in the soft
wind I knew that I would not be going there. Maybe I had been a bad person in
my life, but I hadnt been that bad. I stood up and walked back up to my car and

is a clear sense in which you will never understand it it becomes magical
again. Most people come to terms with their demons. Not all. Jung tells of a
case that suggests that aberrant mental states may not be in themselves an
illness but rather a protection against a greater one. We know that
consciousness never goes to zero except in death. He had a comatose patient at
the Burghölzli who came down with a serious illness while still in the coma.
Until he finally sat up in bed and began to order the nurses about. This went
on until he recovered. Whereupon he went back to sleep. Never to wake again. I
dont even know if the story is true. Probably it is. If for no other reason
than the story is smarter than Jung. Who after all had to hire someone to take
the math exam for medical school. Anyway the answer is yes. I do think that he
was sent. Nothing else really computes.</span></p>

23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>He’d show up from time to time. Usually a bit out of
sorts. Sometimes I’d wake up in a hotel room somewhere and I would hardly even
know how I got there. Lying on the bed in my clothes. And the Kid would be
pacing up and back and he’d be saying things like we dont have much dough but I
got us in here for now. We need to just lay low. Think things over. I felt like
John Dillinger. What things? What are you talking about? You realize that you
havent bathed or eaten in several days. You’re not sure where your car is. You
go downstairs into the street and it’s hot. Midmorning. You walk down to the
corner and there’s a newspaper-stand there and you take a look and it’s the
Miami Herald. Okay. That’s a start. You go back up to the room and the Kid’s
gone. You crawl into the bed and pull the sheet over you. You dont have to do
anything. You’ve got a few hours yet before checkout. Nobody knocks on the
door. Turns out I’ve paid for a week. In the afternoon I went out and came
across my car parked at an expired meter with a ticket stuck in the windshield.
I’d just move my car from street to street. Meter to meter. Ticket to ticket. I
went into a little mom and pop grocery and bought some tomatoes and cheese and
stuff. Some rolls. Went back to my room but the Kid seemed to really be gone.
Actually everything was sort of cool. Except for the drunks banging on your
door at odd hours. A deskclerk in a hotel in Topeka Kansas asked me point blank
if I was a working girl and I told him to take a good look at me and then to ask
himself that if I was a hooker what would I be doing in a shithole like this?</span></p>

kissed him in the car. We kissed twice, actually. The first time just very
softly. He patted my hand as if in all innocence and turned to start the car
but I put my hand on his cheek and turned him to me and we kissed again and
this time there was no innocence in it at all and it took his breath. It took
mine. I put my face on his shoulder and he said we cant do this. You know we
cant do this. I wanted to say that I knew no such thing. I should have. I kissed
his cheek. I had no belief in his resolution but I was wrong. We never kissed
again.</span></p>

immalleable. Except that the more you harbor it the less of it you have. The
liquor of being is leaking out onto the ground. You need to hurry. But the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Not sure why. But you have to understand what the advent
of language was like. The brain had done pretty well without it for quite a few
million years. The arrival of language was like the invasion of a parasitic
system. Co-opting those areas of the brain that were the least dedicated. The
most susceptible to appropriation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>A parasitic invasion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>You’re serious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Yes. The inner guidance of a living system is as
necessary to its survival as oxygen and hydrogen. The governance of any system
evolves coevally with the system itself. Everything from a blink to a cough to
a decision to run for your life. Every faculty but language has the same
history. The only rules of evolution that language follows are those necessary
to its own construction. A process that took little more than an eyeblink. The
extraordinary usefulness of language turned it into an overnight epidemic. It
seems to have spread to every remote pocket of humanity almost instantly. The
same isolation of groups that led to their uniqueness would seem to have been
no protection at all against this invasion and both the form of language and
the strategies by which it gained purchase in the brain seem all but universal.
The most immediate requirement was for an increased capacity for making sounds.
Language seems to have originated in South Africa and this requirement probably
accounts for the clicks in the Khoisan languages. The fact that there were more
things to name than sounds to name them with. In any case the physical facility
for speech was probably the most difficult hurdle. The pharynx became elongated
until the apparatus in its present form has all but strangled its owner. We’re
the only mammalian species that cant swallow and articulate at the same time.
Think of a cat growling while it eats and then try it yourself. Anyway, the
unconscious system of guidance is millions of years old, speech less than a
hundred thousand. The brain had no idea any of this was coming. The unconscious
must have had to do all sorts of scrambling around to accommodate a system that
proved perfectly relentless. Not only is it comparable to a parasitic invasion,
it’s not comparable to anything else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>What makes it interesting is that language evolved
from no known need. It was just an idea. Lysenko rising from the dead. And the
idea, again, was that one thing could represent another. A biological system
under successful assault by human reason.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>I’m not sure I’ve heard evolutionary biology
discussed in such warlike terms. And the unconscious doesnt like to speak to us

23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>Yes. It solves problems and is perfectly capable of
telling us the answers. But million year old habits die hard. It could easily

23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>It is an odd view. I suppose other mathematicians
tend to take Gödel’s views at face value, but those views could reflect a
skepticism concerning reality itself. As for myself I’ve never seen a six. I
dont know what could possibly constitute a mathematical object. In my
experience everything mathematical is in the form of a directive. The numerical
concept of six is totally inert. Gödel wasnt always a platonist, but he’s not
the first scientist to accept an implausible theory simply because it explained
the facts. After the 1931 papers it was clear to him that we are capable of
mathematical insights that a Universal Truth Machine is not. But why Gödel could
see no problem with the notion of mathematical abstractions as factual entities
I couldnt tell you. Platonists seem more or less silent as to the origin of
mathematics and remarkably unconcerned as to what might be the purpose of
computation in an uninhabited universe. I think spookthink is a lot more common
among mathematicians than is generally supposed. In the end Gödel became
something akin to a Deist. Not that he pursued any sort of spiritual practice.
It’s a tradition that runs from Pythagoras to Newton to Cantor. Who after all
attributed a supernatural origin to the transfinites. Aleph Zero. Aleph One. It
couldnt have helped his cause. His notions of relative infinities had to await
the death of an entire generation of German mathematicians before these notions
could even get a hearing. Is the Universe intelligent? Isnt that what’s at
stake? My brother used to say not very. Perhaps sufficient unto the day. Gödel
never says outright that there is a covenant to which all of mathematics
subscribes but you get a clear sense that the hope is there. I know the allure.
Some shimmering palimpsest of eternal abidement. But to claim that numbers
somehow exist in the Universe with no intelligence to enable them does not
require a different sort of mathematics. It requires a different sort of
universe.</span></p>

Russell and Whitehead’s <i>Principia.</i> Russell believed that Gödel was the
only person to have read it in its entirety and he was amazed at Gödel’s grasp
of it. Of course it was never finished. Russell saw the problem with it and he
begged Whitehead not to publish it. They seldom spoke afterwards. A situation
not helped by Russell’s continually trying to fuck Whitehead’s young wife.
Russell had a limited social life at the time and he said that if you couldnt
fuck your friends’ wives then who were you supposed to fuck?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;text-indent:
23.85pt'><span lang=EN-US>I was not. I thought that I would go to Romania and
that when I got there I would go to some small town and buy secondhand clothes
in the market. Shoes. A blanket. I’d burn everything I owned. My passport.
Maybe I’d just put my clothes in the trash. Change money in the street. Then I’d
hike into the mountains. Stay off the road. Take no chances. Crossing the
ancestral lands by foot. Maybe by night. There are bears and wolves up there. I
looked it up. You could have a small fire at night. Maybe find a cave. A
mountain stream. I’d have a canteen for water for when the time came that I was
too weak to move about. After a while the water would taste extraordinary. It
would taste like music. I’d wrap myself in the blanket at night against the
cold and watch the bones take shape beneath my skin and I would pray that I
might see the truth of the world before I died. Sometimes at night the animals
would come to the edge of the fire and move about and their shadows would move
among the trees and I would understand that when the last fire was ashes they
would come and carry me away and I would be their eucharist. And that would be
my life. And I would be happy.</span></p>
